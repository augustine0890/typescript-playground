# TypeScript Quickly

## Getting familiar with TypeScript
- TypeScipt is compile-to-JavaScript language. A program written in TypeScript has to be transpiled into JS first, and then it can be executed in the browser or a standalone JS engine.
- Complier: a program that takes source code written in one language and produce a output file in in some other language. (C cod --> binary executable (machine code)).
- Transpilers: are also known as source-to-source. Take in a source code file and convert it to another source code file in some other language or a different version of the same language. This output still has to through a compiler or interpreter to be able to run on the machine.
